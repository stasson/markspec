## Block

```markdown
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

  Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they

belong to the previous footnote.
```

## Inline

```markdown
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since
you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
note.]
```
